I primarily teach macroeconomics. I have taught tutorials for Core Macroeconomics and Money and Banking and Jesus College, University of Oxford. 
<br />
<br />
In the past I have also taught and assisted teaching by holding tutorials and office hours in conventional courses and summerschools on macroeconomics methods, continuous time, machine learning and neural networks, monetary economics, microeconomics, quantitative economics, and economic policy evaluation at the University of Oxford and Johns Hopkins University.
